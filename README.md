This repository holds the data collected by the McMaster Experimental Reduced Gravity Team (MERGE) during 2019-2022.

## About MERGE & Our Experiment
The McMaster Experimental Reduced Gravity Team (MERGE) is a team from McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada formed primarily of undergraduate students. 
We are intersted in the scientific opportunities that reduced gravity environments on Earth can provide. 

During the 2019-2022 period, our team focused on the effects of slat screens in mitigating fluid slosh, for future applications in on-orbit spacecraft refuelling. 

We designed and created a custom setup which allowed for fluid injection into three chambers, two of which were outffitted with slat screens. 
On two parabolic flight campaigns we collected data on fluid motion during microgravity. 
Fluid was injected into the chambers during microgravity, and the motion was captured via mounted cameras. 
The two flight campaigns each flew a different fluids -- water and 3M (TM) Fluorinert FC-72 (TM). 
These fluids were chosen for their analagous properties to common spacecraft propellants. 

## Repository Setup
`/video` contains both raw video footage and clipped footage showing an example parabola for each fluid (water & FC-72 (TM)). 

`/loadcells` contains raw data from load cells mounted to each chamber
